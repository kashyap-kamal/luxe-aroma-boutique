## Common Issues & Solutions

- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Sign out and sign in again
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Password change fails
**Solution**: Ensure:
- New password is at least 6 characters
- Both password fields match
- You're logged in with a valid session

### Issue: Phone field not in database
**Solution**: Run the updated SQL schema:
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run the updated handle_new_user() function
# from supabase-auth-schema.sql
```
